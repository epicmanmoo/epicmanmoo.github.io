  1. TripMe App: This app was an Android Application made with 3 other people during
     DubHacks 2019. The summary of this app is that it plans a day of activities for
     a user based on a city they provided and their specific interests. We used Android,
     Java to make this application. This was a fun project as we spent 24ish hours working
     on it and in the end we were able to learn a lot from it. [Here's a link to the GitHub.](https://github.com/epicmanmoo/TripMe)
