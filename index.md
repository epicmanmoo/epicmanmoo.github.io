## Who am I?
  Hi! Welcome to this website that I kinda made? ðŸ˜› My name is Mooaz Nasir.
  People usually pronounce my first name in different ways but the correct way to say it is "Maaz".
  It's hard to even describe because there
  are no syllables in my first name. However, you've probably heard of moss, the thing
  that grows on trees. Replace the ssssss sounds with z's and you'll be able to pronounce
  my name. Anyway, I let people call me "Mo" or something because it's easier to pronounce.
  Enough about my name, there's more interesting things than that (I think). I don't know
  I guess, sometimes I'm more talkative but other times I'm lost in thought. I would say
  that I'm a pretty deep person, as people (mostly friends) have said about me. However,
  everyone is a unique person. Each person has a story behind them, and they are all
  worth hearing! I hope to sort of share my story in this website and introduce
  reader(s), if there are even any, to who I am and what I do!.

  Continuing where I left off, I love to
