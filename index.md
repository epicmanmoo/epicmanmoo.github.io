## Who am I?
  Hi! Welcome to this website that I kind of made? My name is Mooaz Nasir.
  People usually pronounce my first name in different ways but the correct way to say it is "Maaz".
  It's hard to even describe because there
  are no syllables in my first name. However, you've probably heard of moss, the thing
  that grows on trees. Replace the 'ssssss' sounds with z's and you'll be able to pronounce
  my name. Anyway, I let people call me "Mo" or something because it's easier to pronounce.
  Enough about my name, there's more interesting things than that (I think). I don't know
  I guess, sometimes I'm more talkative but other times I'm lost in thought. I would say
  that I'm a pretty deep person, as people (mostly friends) have said about me. However,
  everyone is a unique person. Each person has a story behind them, and they are all
  worth hearing! I hope to sort of share my story in this website and introduce
  reader(s), if there are even any, to who I am and what I do!.

## Who am I? (Continued)
  Continuing where I left off, I finally got a chance to update this website!
  High school itself was extremely fast in my opinion and at the end of it, it feels as
  if it just started. I guess it's hard to believe 4 years of life went by that fast.
  I'll probably think about this same thing when I graduate college in another 3 years.
  Let's just be broad here, I'm almost 18 and I loved programming every since I realized
  how powerful technology is. I didn't really _like_ programming a while ago because it never
  made sense to me. I was confused when I took a class in high school about computer science
  because it made no sense, and I was lost all the time. I had some sort of inside call
  to relearn everything on my own. I don't know why anyway, but I did just that. I began
  relearning how programming works and the things you could do with it. Only then I realized
  how broad of a field Software Engineering is and that is mainly the reason I want to pursue it!
  (TBC)
